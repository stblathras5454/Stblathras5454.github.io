CS 499 ePortfolio – Steven Blathras
Overview

This repository contains my ePortfolio for the CS 499 Computer Science Capstone at Southern New Hampshire University. It showcases the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout the program, demonstrated through enhancements to a single artifact across three categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

The portfolio highlights both technical growth and professional development, while also serving as a resource for future employers to evaluate my abilities as a computer scientist.

Enhancements
1. Software Design and Engineering

Artifact: CS 330 – 3D Graphics Scene (OpenGL/C++)

Enhancements: Improved structure and readability of SceneManager.cpp by refactoring code and adding professional comments. Implemented small but meaningful design changes to align with industry best practices.

2. Algorithms and Data Structures

Artifact: CS 340 – Animal Shelter MongoDB Dashboard (Python/Dash)

Enhancements: Optimized the AnimalShelter.py CRUD module with improved error handling, algorithmic efficiency, and better data filtering logic. The Jupyter Notebook dashboard (ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb) was also updated to include enhanced filtering, visualizations, and user interaction features.

3. Databases

Artifact: CS 340 – Animal Shelter MongoDB Dashboard (Python/Dash)

Enhancements: Expanded database interaction logic to better demonstrate skills in query optimization and data management. Enhanced the connection handling in AnimalShelter.py and refined MongoDB queries for efficiency and scalability.
