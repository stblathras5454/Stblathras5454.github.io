# Steven Blathras – CS499 Capstone Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site for my CS499 Computer Science Capstone.

This portfolio highlights three original and enhanced projects that demonstrate my skills in:

- **Software Design and Engineering**
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**
- **Databases**

Each artifact includes:
- The original version as submitted in a prior course
- An enhanced version that improves upon the original
- A written narrative explaining the enhancement and how it aligns with CS program outcomes
